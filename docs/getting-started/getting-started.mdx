# Getting started

Starting with a new technology may be challenging. We are working hard to make this process as smooth as possible, letting you enjoy the benefits of Atomic layout in your projects. We do not have a goal to make you good at using a library, but to make you experienced with layout principles in general.

This section alone contains a high-level overview of topics to get started with Atomic layout. Bookmark it and let your journey into the future of web layouts begin.
